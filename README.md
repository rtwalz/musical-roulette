to-do
- ~~if multiple people like same song, make the correct answer whoever likes it more, and add note on the results screen saying "x and y like this song, but y likes it more!"~~
- ~~show fade in animation when song name is revealed (sort of like the Shazam app)~~
- ~~fade out audio~~
- let people pick if they want the sounds playing (right now it plays on just host's device)
- add more of a description of the game on the homepage
- add ending screen (ability to start new game again, ~~see list of all of the songs played~~)
- make it possible to rejoin the game if you accidentally lose connection
- add ability to create a spotify playlist of all the songs at the end of the game
